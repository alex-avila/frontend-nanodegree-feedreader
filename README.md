# feedreader

A web-based application that reads RSS feeds from the Udacity Blog, CSS Tricks, HTML5 Rocks, & Linear Digressions. Feed reader code taken from **Udacity's [frontend-nanodegree-feedreader](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)**. This app loads content from the aforementioned blogs and produces a feed of various articles and you can choose to filter the articles by source.

My contribution was adding the tests for the app using the [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine) testing framework.

## Steps to run the application

To run using the terminal simply run these commands

```js
git clone https://github.com/alex-avila/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
cd frogger-game
open index.html
```

...or

1. Download the ZIP file
2. Unzip the ZIP file
3. Open the newly created folder
4. Open the index.html file in your browser
5. Enjoy all the feeds!
